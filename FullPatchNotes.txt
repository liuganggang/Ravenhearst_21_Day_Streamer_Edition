Thank yous and info


Ravenhearst has descended upon us! Ravenhearst is an SDX mod that adds over 200 new items, stations, weapons, decorative pieces and more to give you an experience like never before. Military presence in the Wastelands, Awful creatures that come out to play at night and an overhauled Progression system that rewards players of all types while increasing the distance it takes to get to the end game are some of the things awaiting your play through.


Keep in Mind this is a mod that is very much a work in progress. There will be frequent updates and game save wipes when necessary. We can NOT offer help or support to older version of the Mod. Please stay Current if Possible.

2.2 was a huge unexpected success and with 3.0 we tried our hardest to deliver a more rewarding and complete experience for all of you. This version is a labor of love for sure by many people. Our goal was to slow every possible gameplay style a bit to give a more rewarding and hopefully more scary survival experience. Day one will NOT be easy this go around!

My first endeavour was very much a solo project with some input from our server members. This time around we assembled a team of the best people who understood what Ravenhearst is about. I want to give a second to thank them. You should as well. Without them, their hours of testing, arguing, discussion, brainstorming and blood sweat and tears 3.0 would not be what it is right now.

Sinder, for being loyal as F and for her reassuring talks in my time of anger and doubt. She put in hours upon hours of questing, testing, starting over, designing our town for our server and good lord going over descriptions with a fine tooth comb. There is so much more that I can never truly thank her enough for.

Dan Capo for his tireless work in food balancing, poi editing and pouring over XMLS for mistakes, misspellings, categories and so much more. Dan has truly been a gift to our mod. When you die of hunger, please give Dan a special thought 

Fallen Dice for his firmness on balancing, and helping me to see things when I was very biased in one direction. Frantic Dan for his work on checking weapons and balancing as well as progression and his patience in starting over. Copendub for his countless hours of testing during a busy schedule. Bradmin for his loyalty and his ideas as well as his help on the test servers, along with 2nd Recon for his inspiring ideas. Dex for his friendship and advice. So many people came together to make this mod special.

Also bear in mind that there are SDX models in this game and as such loading times may be a bit slower than usual. Patience will be the key here. If you do experience in game lag turning down zombies can help with this.

I want to give credit and thanks to those who have influenced me in ways I can not express. Pacco, Valmar, Dwallorde, sphereii, Guppycur, drkstardragon, Spider, Xyth, Skippy, Xtrakicking, StompyNZ, Smegz0r and so many others who without your help and guidance I couldn't have made this mod possible.

Special Thanks to Sirillion for working with us to create the awesome UI you see in game. You can check out his work here

For another fantastic SDX mod check out Sergant1000 and his Experimental Recipes mod. Over the year of piecing together some of this mod we have included his pickaxe and his water bottles.

A very special thank you to Xyth, Morte and the rest of the Starvation Team. The Vintorez model is indeed the model used in Starvation. This may not be distributed or used without their permission.

Starvation

Special thank you to Kaiser502 for his radiated sewers and generators.

Special shout to Tin and his fantastic work on random gen and his discussions on Zombie AI. We have used many of his tweaks over the course of developing Ravenhearst and they have made our mod that much stronger. Check out his AWESOME harddcore mod The Devils Eden

TopMinder gets a HUGE thank you for his awesome and amazing POIs like the Hospital. Andyjoki's Pyramid is a HUGE end game goal in Ravenhearst and we thank him for allowing us to use it. These POIs bring so much life to our world and we are eternally grateful for letting us include them.

MANY huge thanks to a very talented new SDX modder for allowing the use of his vehicles in our mod stedman420. He is preparing his OWN mod and his work can be found here
